brackets-htmlhint
=================

A Brackets wrapper for the HTMLHint library (see credit below).  
Provides Brackets Code Inspection for HTML and XML.


Usage
=====
If you want to change the default rules place a `.htmlhintrc` and/or `.xmlhintrc` file at the project root.  
Check the default ruleset [here](https://github.com/yaniswang/HTMLHint/wiki/Usage).

Global default options are available under "Debug > Open Preferences File" by adding or modifying "htmlhint.options" and "xmlhint.options".
It also uses "jshint.options" and "csslint.options" for script and style tags.
